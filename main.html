                Hello! My name is Nick and I am currently a senior attending Rutgers University. 
                I have a passion for Computer Science and am looking to step into the industry as a software engineer!
                I am comfortable with languages such as Python, Java, C, HTML/CSS, and more. 
                I am also familiar with software development life cycles such as SCRUM.
                In my free time, I enjoy making music, audio engineering, working out, and learning new skills!

                    This application was the final project for CS431 (Software Engineering) taught by professor Lily Chang.
                    My team created a website that served as an uncensored forum for users to discuss and view stock tickers.  
                    As Product Owner in a group of three other classmates, I led our team to deploy our software with the vision we initially imagined.
                    Our team used Django for the back-end, PostgreSQL for our database implementation, and deployed the website using AWS and Heroku.

                        This application was my submission for the Rutgers' 24-Hour "HackRU"" Hackathon in Fall 2020.
                        In this short time span, I created a fully-functional password manager using Python and Tkinter. 
                        My goal with this project was to create a personal and 100% offline password manager - I do not trust other password managers with my information!
                        I used Fernet encryption in this project, allowing users to save their password data files without their information being saved in plaintext.
                        Users need to know their key or pass in a key file to decode their information.
                        While "HackRU" has ended, I still maintain this code and plan on implementing more functionality (such as storing credit card information and more) in the future.

                        This project is a recipe manager android app that I created to familiarize myself with Android Studio and app development.
                        I used Java for the back-end and Google Firebase's Realtime Database and Storage for the database implementation.
                        This project was not deployed on to the Google Play Store.

                        This application was the final project for CS336 (Principles Of Information And Data Management) taught by professor Antonio Miranda.
                        My team created a website that served as a platform to reserve fictional train schedules. 
                        Users were able to view train schedules, reserve a train, communicate with customer representatives, and more.
                        Admin dashboard functionality was also implemented. 
                        In my group with two other classmates, we used Java and JSP for the back-end, MySQL and MySQL workbench for the the database implementation,
                        and we deployed our website with AWS RDS and EC2.
